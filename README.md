# TattooStudio
This is a simple CRM-type application designed for tattoo shops and studios. A frequent problem in this business is that clients will have long-term projects but will require multiple appointments. Often, however, they are not ready to schedule a follow-up appointment at the end of the current appointment. This results in tattoo artists having unfinished projects and unrealized revenue. The application is a simple way to keep track of one's clients and send them reminders via email, text, and sms. These reminders should help artists schedule more appointments, finish more projects (which helps build their portfolio) and see more revenue. In a large studio it may be used as a tool for the shop receptionist or manager to drive overall sales. 

# Approach 
Tattoo Studio Manager is buil as a web app using Angular,. I wanted to increase my understanding of Angular and in particular understand how Services are used in Angular to perform functions and manage data and state. I also just like the simplicity and ease of project generation using Angular. Angular is designed with mobile in mind, so this app will be usable on mobile and particularly on tablets, which are more and more in use in retail and service environments

For the back-end I opted to try out Google's newest cloud database service, Firestore. I wanted something simple that would be easy to use and deploy, and Firestore delivers. It is ridiculously easy to set up and deploy. It is also extremely fast and is easy to understand. It's fairly similar in structure to a Mongo database. It also advertises itself as massively scalable, so it should work for any application.
